## IN-APP HELPER TEXT

### AI Assistant Panel
**Description:** The AI Operations Assistant answers real touring questions — settlements, budgets, advances, crew logistics, crisis situations, and more. Select your role and tour scale from the left sidebar, then ask anything. Responses are grounded in institutional touring knowledge, not generic web answers.

### Tours Page
**Description:** Create and manage saved tours. Each tour is a workspace — ask AI questions within the context of a specific tour, save conversation history, and attach budgets and settlements to individual projects. All Q&A is linked to the tour so you can reference it later.

### Budget Builder
**Description:** Generate a structured budget template for any tour type. Input your tour scale, number of shows, and expected guarantees — the AI returns a full line-item budget with category estimates and projected margin ranges. All figures are informational and not financial advice.

### Settlement Helper
**Description:** Input your show financials and get a step-by-step settlement walkthrough in plain language. The tool calculates adjusted gross, house nut, net receipts, overage pool, and artist payment — and flags common watchouts like double-charged items, soft ticket shortfalls, and house nut disputes.

### Crisis Mode
**Description:** Toggle Crisis Mode when something goes wrong on show day. All AI responses become short, numbered, and action-focused. No preamble. Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. Designed for use when you're under pressure and need immediate guidance — not background reading.

### Knowledge Base Search
**Description:** Search structured, reference-quality answers across institutional touring knowledge — advancing, settlements, crew management, international logistics, mental health, and more. Results are formatted as articles with headings, checklists, and key watchouts — not conversational chat.

### HOW A TOUR MANAGER CAN USE CONCERTINDUSTRY.COM

ConcertIndustry.com was built with the Tour Manager at the center. On most tours of this scale, you're handling all the accounting and settlement yourself — no tour accountant, no backup. This tool is designed to support that reality.

**Where to Start**
After signing up, set your role to "Tour Manager" and your tour scale in the sidebar. If you're regularly doing different scales, you can switch anytime — the AI adjusts its responses accordingly.

**What to Ask First**
Start with a question you'd normally Google or call someone about. Try one of these:

1. *"Walk me through how a standard vs. deal works and when the artist earns an overage."*
2. *"What's the right way to structure per diems for a 30-day domestic tour with a crew of 12?"*
3. *"What are the biggest financial risks I should be tracking on a theater tour?"*
4. *"How do I respond to a promoter who claims production costs were higher than agreed?"*
5. *"Give me a settlement checklist for a 2,000-cap club show."*

**Budget Builder (Pro)**
Use this before finalizing deals. Input your tour type, number of shows, expected capacity, and guarantees. The AI generates a full budget template with all major categories — travel, hotels, buses, crew, production, insurance, contingency, and more — with estimated ranges for each. It also shows a projected margin range so you can see if the tour pencils out before committing.

**Settlement Helper (Pro)**
Use this day-of-show or night-of-show during settlement. Input all the line items from the promoter's settlement sheet — gross tickets, taxes, fees, venue rent, marketing, production reimbursements, artist guarantee, and overage split. The tool walks through the math step-by-step and flags anything unusual. Great for double-checking a promoter's numbers before you sign.

**Why Upgrade to Pro?**
The free tier lets you ask 75 advisory questions — ideal for testing the tool and getting quick operational answers. Pro gives you unlimited queries plus the tools that actually save you time in production:
- Budget templates that take 10 minutes instead of 2 hours
- Settlement modeling you can run in the car between venues
- Saved tours with full conversation history you can reference month-to-month

### HOW A PRODUCTION MANAGER CAN USE CONCERTINDUSTRY.COM

As a Production Manager, your job front-loads. The advance calls, the rider interpretation, the truck routing, the crew calls, the department coordination — all of it happens before the show. ConcertIndustry.com is designed to be your operational reference when you don't have time to dig through old email threads.

**Where to Start**
Set your role to "Production Manager" and your tour scale. The AI responses immediately reflect the production realities of your tour size — union labor considerations for arenas, leaner crew expectations for clubs.

**What to Ask First**
1. *"What should I advance with a 3,000-cap theater I've never worked before?"*
2. *"Give me a load-in call sheet template for a headline arena show."*
3. *"What are common day-of issues when the support act runs over on stage time?"*
4. *"How do I handle a last-minute rigging certification issue with the venue's house crew?"*
5. *"What should I include in my first production call with a new promoter?"*

**Knowledge Base**
The Knowledge Base is particularly useful for PMs. Search "advancing" or "load-in" or "rigging" and get structured, checklist-style articles you can adapt for your specific situation. These aren't generic how-tos — they're grounded in real touring practice.

**Crisis Mode**
Toggle Crisis Mode when you're mid-show-day and something goes sideways. A truck hasn't arrived. Sound check is blown because of a venue power issue. A crew member is injured. Crisis Mode gives you immediate action steps — not paragraphs, not context, just what to do next.

**Why Upgrade to Pro?**
Save tours and build up per-tour conversation history. When you come back to a city or venue six months later, your advance notes and Q&A from the last run are right there. For PMs doing repeat markets or festival routes, this adds up quickly.

### HOW A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT CAN USE CONCERTINDUSTRY.COM

Production Assistants are the backbone of the touring operation — and often the ones who don't get enough direct guidance. This tool is built to give you clear, practical answers without requiring years of experience to understand.

**Where to Start**
Set your role to "Production Assistant" and your tour scale. PA responses are always more structured — numbered lists, clear steps, explanations of the "why" so you can adapt if things change.

**What to Ask First**
1. *"How do I set up and manage a hotel rooming list for a 15-person tour party?"*
2. *"What should a PA's day-of-show checklist look like for a theater show?"*
3. *"How do I professionally handle a situation where a crew member misses their call time?"*
4. *"What's the best way to organize a travel sheet when there are flight changes happening constantly?"*
5. *"How do I create a laminate and credentials list for a run of 20 shows?"*

**Knowledge Base**
Use the Knowledge Base as your reference library. Filter by "PA" role to get answers calibrated to your responsibilities. Topics like "guest list management," "runner coordination," "day-of paperwork," and "travel logistics" all have dedicated coverage.

**For PAs Looking to Move Up**
The AI can also help you understand what's happening at the TM and PM level — how a settlement works, what a production advance covers, how budgets are structured. The more you understand the full picture, the faster you advance.

**Why Upgrade to Pro?**
If you're working consistently with the same team or artist, saved tours let you build up a reference library of answers specific to your operation. It also unlocks the Budget and Settlement tools — even if you're not running those processes yourself, understanding them makes you a better assistant.
